Serialization:
Serialization in REST assured context is a process of converting a java object into Request body(Payload).
REST assured also supports deserialization by converting Response body back to Java object.

Advantages:
Easy to parse and extract response(json/xml) values if they are wrapped as Java object.
User friendly methods can be created which makes code more readable.

Design approach:
Java object is constructed with the support of POJO classes
POJO classes are created based on the request?Response payload.

Libraries required:
Jackson, Jackson2, Gson, Johnzon in the classpath and for XML you need JAXB
