Cucumber introduces with a language called Gherking.

Gherkin is a Business Readable Domain Specific Language.
It basically sets up some ground rules on how we write the steps on a certaine behavior of the application

This is useful for avoid misinterpretation of statement by Business Analysts, Developers and QA

Keywords in Cucumber:  Scenario, Feature, Feature file, Scenario outline, Step Definition

In Cucumber testcases are represented as Scenarios.

Scenarios contain Steps which are rquivalent to test Steps and use the following keywords(Gherkin syntax) to denote them. Given, When, Then, But, And(All are case sensitive)

Scenario: Make minimum due payment
    Given: user is on Pay credit card bill page
    When: user fills all details and selects Minimum amount option
    And: user clicks on Pay button
    Then: Credit card payment confirmation page is displayed
    And: Reference number is displayed
    But: error message is not displayed


Feature and Feature File:
Feature represents Business requirment
Feature File acts a test suite which consists of all scenarios

We can create a Feature File using .feature extension

Payment.feature file contains all scenarios.

Scenario Outline is used when we need to run the tests and multiple datasets(or tables)

Scenario Outline: Check if String is a Palindrom
Given: I entered a word <wordsToTest>
When: I test it for palindrome
Then: the output should be <output>
Examples:
wordsToTest || output
Refer           true
Coin            false
Space           false
racecar         true

This can also be called as parametrization as we are passing the wordsToTest and output as parameters to validate.
