We have the issue/bug ID store somewhere from the previous POST request.
Now we will try to add an attachement to the bug that we previously created

Steps to add attachment to the bug in Jira from Postman
1. Navigate to https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-issue-attachments/#api-rest-api-3-issue-issueidorkey-attachments-post
2. Observe the curl section for Add attachment
        curl --location --request POST 'https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/TEST-123/attachments'
        -u 'email@example.com:<api_token>'
        -H 'X-Atlassian-Token: no-check'
        --form 'file=@"myfile.txt"'
3. Replace the domain with our own domain name and the TEST-123 with the issue/bug ID we created earlier.
4. Result: https://saipraveenseva.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/10001/attachments
5. Open header section and add the Authorization along with the Key as we did in the previous POST request while creating the bug
6. Add one more header "X-Atlassian-Token" with the value "no-check"
7. Now nvaigate to Body section and select "form-data" from the dropdown
8. Add a key "file" and select "File" from the dropdown
9. Add the screenshot in the "value" field.
10. Now hit on Send to send the post request.
11. Once the request is sent we should see a "200 OK" status code in the output console. This means success.
12. Navigate to our project in Jira and refresh the bug we filed earlier.
13. The attachment should be visible in the bug.
