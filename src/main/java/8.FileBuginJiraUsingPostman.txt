Step by step process of creating a bug in Jira using Postman

1. Setup an atlassian account and host a website(saipraveenseva.atlassian.net)
2. Create a project and file a bug manually to get to know how things work
3. Now we need to create a bug using Postman
4. Create a new collection and add a new request(POST request).
5. Makes sure there is a header "Content-type" with the value "application/json"
6. Now add another header named "Authorization" and value for this can be obtained by following the below steps.
    a. Navigate to https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens in the browser.
    b. Create an API token, name it and copy it once created.
    c. The API token is only accepted in a Base64 encoded format.
    d. Navigate to https://www.base64encode.org/ paste the API token and enter your login id before the token followed by ":"

    f. Tap on encode below and copy the encoded value.
    g. Navigate to postman and in the "Authorization" header that we added earlier, the value section should contain the value
    h.

    i. Step h is the encoded key that we copied and it should be preceeded with a keyword "Basic" and a space.
    j. Basic indicates we are using Basic authorization and there are different kinds of authorization that we can use.
    k. Now navigate to body section in postman and paste this
    {
      "fields": {
        "project": {
          "key": "SCRUM"        // This key should be obtained from Jira project setting
        },
        "summary": "Dropdowns issue",   // This is the title of the bug
        "description": {
          "version": 1,
          "type": "doc",
          "content": [
            {
              "type": "paragraph",
              "content": [
                {
                  "type": "text",
                  "text": "Your bug description here.  This can be multiple lines." // This is the description of the bug
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        },
        "issuetype": {
          "name": "Bug"
        }
        // ... other fields
      }
    }

    l.There are other fields as well but for time being and the sake of simplicity I just added summary, description and issue type:bug.
    m. Now tap on "Send" in the postman which will send a post request that will create a bug in our Jira project
    n. Navigate to Jira project and make sure the Bug is created with the filed we specified in Postman
    o. When the issue/bug is create we also get the issue id in the postman in the console. save it somewhere.
